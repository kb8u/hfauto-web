You'll need to have the W1TR application send status info to this program by
editing the W1TR configuration file.  Go to Tools->Edit Config File and
select HFAUTO_APP to edit.  In the [Network] section, add 127.0.0.1:15080
to the UDP_Broadcast line, save and close the file and then restart the
W1TR HF Auto Application.  If you need to use a different IP and port, also
set in in the h_fauto_web.conf file of this application using your favorite
editor.
